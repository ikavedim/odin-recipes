    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Nattō (納豆), spelled as natto in standard English language use, is a traditional Japanese food made from whole soybeans that have been fermented with Bacillus subtilis var. natto.[1] It is often served as a breakfast food with rice.[2] It is served with karashi mustard, soy or tare sauce, and sometimes Japanese bunching onion.
